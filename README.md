What cloud environment you decided to use

What changes you needed to make in order to make the mysql instance available to external computers (config file? opening ports?) 
An example dataset that you have found (selected) to insert into the mysql database (provide the sqlalchemy/python code used to upload/insert the data) [there is no limitations, min/max of what I am looking for here] ---- REMINDER: in your python file, you will likely have to provide credentials, please use a .ENV file to load credentials so you do not hard-code the passwords/usernames into your github repo] [example python file for connecting/creating: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MPkNpvwzJgjcQ2fE8AUSOltPt6FtGvRB?usp=sharing]
